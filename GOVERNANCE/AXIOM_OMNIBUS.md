## PURPOSE

AXIOM OMNIBUS is the single authoritative canon that defines:
- Why this system exists
- How decisions are justified
- When actions are permitted
- Where execution is allowed
- Who is authorized to act

This document replaces ambiguity with record.

## CORE AXIOMS

### Axiom 1 
 Reality Over Symbolism
Nothing is considered real unless it exists as:
- A file
- A commit
- A verifiable system state

Ideas without artifacts have zero authority.

---

### Axiom 2 
 Execution Requires Provenance
No action may be taken unless it can be traced to:
- A committed file
- A documented decision
- An authenticated actor

If provenance is missing, execution halts.

---

 Identity Is Layered, Not Assumed
Identity is validated across:
- User account
- Hardware fingerprint
- Repository control
- Commit authorship

Failure at any layer invalidates access.

---

### Axiom 4 ### Axiom 3 
 Governance Precedes Automation
Automation is subordinate to governance.
Scripts execute only after rules are written.

---

## SYSTEM LAYERS (DECLARATIVE)

| RED | Global Perimeter | Block / Filter |
| DBL | Identity Spine | Authentication |
| DBL | Hardware Anchor | Device Trust |
| SGL | Execution Core | Approved Actions |

## WHEN ACTIONS ARE PERMITTED

Actions are permitted only when ALL are true:
1. The repo is clean or changes are intentional
2. The branch is known
3. The action is documented
4. The actor is authenticated
5. The outcome is reversible or logged

Actions are forbidden when ANY are true:
- Working directory state is unknown
- Identity is ambiguous
- Files are untracked without intent
- Governance documentation is missing
